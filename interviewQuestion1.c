//Write a function in the language of your choice that 
//accepts an arbitrary number of lists of natural numbers, 
//each list of arbitrary length, and returns all the gaps that exist 
// in the union of all the lists.  For example the lists { 3, 5 } { 2, 7, 3 } { 6 } 
// have a gap of length 1 starting at the number 3.
//Applications that do not include a working solution to the above problem will not be considered.
